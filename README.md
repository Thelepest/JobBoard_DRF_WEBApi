# JobBoard_DRF_WEBApi
Job Board developed with #Django #Rest Framework connected with #PostgreSQL local Database. 3 endpoints with output on #Browsable #API.
Possibility to edit, add, get and delete the job offers and the employees instances.
Before using that, you'll need to create a superuser with username and password written in settings.py, and have a postgresql terminal on your computer.

Developed in VSC in Python Language. 
The plugs required to let the code work are reported in the file "requirements.txt".
